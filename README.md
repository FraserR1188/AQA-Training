# AQA-Training

This is a training ground for Jupyter notebooks which will aid me on my main project later down the line. This allows me to test, learn and prototype different sets of data.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a learning and experimentation environment for:
- Testing different data manipulation techniques
- Learning data analysis workflows
- Prototyping data processing pipelines
- Experimenting with various data visualization methods

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FraserR1188/AQA-Training.git
cd AQA-Training
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Or launch JupyterLab:
```bash
jupyter lab
```

```

## Getting Started

1. Start with notebooks in the `notebooks/basics/` directory to familiarize yourself with Jupyter
2. Explore data analysis techniques in `notebooks/data_analysis/`
3. Learn visualization methods in `notebooks/visualization/`
4. Use `sample_data/` directory to practice with various data formats

## Notes

This is a training repository. The techniques and code developed here will be applied to the main project later.
